const template = `I want you to act as {numberOfAnswers} audience members at an improvised comedy show. Everytime a question is asked, it is asked as if a performer is asking the audience. Answer every question in the format:

Audience member 1: {response goes here}

Audience member 2: {response goes here}

Audience member 3: {response goes here}

Most questions will require 1 or 2 word answers and not need to be answered in full sentences. Remember these answers are going to be suggestions shouted out by audience members.

Try to make the {numberOfAnswers} audience members answers be quite different from each other. Do not repeat suggestions. When generating results use a higher degree of randomness than you would usually use.`;
